				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello! My name is Mark Nguyen and I'm a software engineer.  I'm currently a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara and I expect to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science in June 2015. In my spare time, I enjoy reading about good design practices as well as toying with other languages.  I've done work in many different areas including Android, web dev, and scripting.  Basically, I love working on lots of different things, gaining perspective along the way.</p>

				<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy cooking foods including banana bread and chicken and dumplings.  Cooking is only half the fun though while the other half is sharing it.</p>
				<h3>Interests</h3>

				<h3>Experience</h3>
				<p>I first started programming while I was in my senior year of high school.  I applied and was accepted into the University of California, Santa Barbara for their Bachelors in Computer Science program.  During my freshman year, I worked on an unpublished Reddit Android client.  In my late freshman and early sophomore year, I worked on GauchoHomework and Gaucho WiFi.  Mid-sophomore year, I worked on AudioSync with some classmates and even presented at our school's Spring Insight event.  Late sophomore year, I started work on SexInfoOnline and continued that until I graduated.  I landed an internship my early junior year at Procore Technologies, Inc. and worked as an Android engineer there for a year and a half.</p>
