How To Install
==============

You'll need a web hosting service that supports PHP.

If you're running on your local file system, just copy the files directly to your root http folder (or wherever you like).

If you're using a hosting plan, you can use the deploy script:

`./deploy.sh USERNAME PASSWORD URL`
